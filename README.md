Sight Guide is an innovative, Flutter-based mobile application designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings with greater independence and confidence. This application incorporates advanced technologies to enhance spatial awareness and provide real-time guidance, making daily navigation safer and more accessible. The app includes three core features, each carefully designed to address different aspects of mobility for visually impaired users:

1) Object Detection
The Object Detection feature leverages real-time camera input to identify and describe objects in the user's surroundings. By processing the video feed, the application provides audio feedback about nearby objects, enabling users to gain an accurate understanding of their environment.

2) Free Navigation
The Free Navigation feature allows users to move freely in their environment with real-time obstacle detection and avoidance. The application uses advanced algorithms to identify obstacles, calculate their distances, and estimate their positions relative to the user. Through intuitive audio instructions, users are guided on how to navigate around these obstacles safely. This feature ensures that users can confidently explore unfamiliar or crowded areas without requiring constant physical assistance, significantly improving their mobility and independence.

3) Guided Navigation
The Guided Navigation feature integrates Google Maps to provide a comprehensive navigation solution for reaching specific destinations. Users can input their destination either by typing or using voice commands for convenience. Once the destination is set, the camera preview activates, combining object detection with navigation assistance. The app guides users toward their desired location by providing step-by-step instructions, while simultaneously detecting and alerting them to obstacles along their path. This dual functionality ensures a safe and efficient journey, even in complex or dynamic environments.
